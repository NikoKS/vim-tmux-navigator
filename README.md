Vim Tmux Navigator
==================

This plugin is a fork of [christoomey's vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator). This fork is created to add a nesting feature to the plugin so that navigation would work for a tmux window inside a ssh session inside a tmux window.

This fork also remove the auto-cycling behavior for tmux as I found it to be confusing
